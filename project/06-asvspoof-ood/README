General
----------
This is project for https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04775. 
CM models here can produce a confidence score for each trial


Usage
----------
1. Download [ASVspoof 2019 LA](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2555) 
   and convert FLAC to WAV

   Put eval set waves to ./DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/eval
   Put train and dev sets to ./DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/train_dev
   
   Make sure that the two folders contain the waveform files: 

   $: ls DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/eval 
   LA_E_1000147.wav
   LA_E_1000273.wav
   LA_E_1000791.wav
   LA_E_1000841.wav
   LA_E_1000989.wav
   ...
   $: ls DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/eval | wc -l
   71237

   $: ls DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/train_dev
   LA_D_1000265.wav
   LA_D_1000752.wav
   LA_D_1001095.wav
   LA_D_1002130.wav
   LA_D_1002200.wav
   LA_D_1002318.wav
   ...

   $: ls DATA/asvspoof2019_LA/train_dev | wc -l
   50224


2. Run demonstration script   
   $: bash 00_demo.sh PATH_TO_PROJECT
   where PATH_TO_PROJECT can be one of this folder name
   AM-softmax-conf/config_train_asvspoof2019    
   AM-softmax-maxprob/config_train_asvspoof2019
   AM-softmax-energy/config_train_asvspoof2019
   Softmax-conf/config_train_asvspoof2019         
   Softmax-energy/config_train_asvspoof2019       
   Softmax-maxprob/config_train_asvspoof2019
   Softmax-energy/config_train_asvspoof2019_esp

   This demo.sh will 
   1. install conda environment if it is not ready
   2. download pre-trained models, additional datasets (espnet, vcc)
   3. scoring the test sets using pre-trained models
   4. train a new model
   6. scoring the test sets using the newly trained model
  
   Softmax-energy/config_train_asvspoof2019_bc10 can be run 
   after manually downloading the BC data. See Note 1 below

3. Get evaluation metrics using 02_eval_metric.ipynb
   This is a Jupyter notebook.
   Please check it on github website

log_train_*.txt is self-explanable.

log_eval_*_score.txt has five columns (see Note 2):
  Output, File name, label, score, confidence
  Output, LA_E_1066571, 1, 19.160793, 20.1

Note
----------
1. Blizzard data must be downloaded manually by each user, due to licence.
   Thus, please do not try Softmax-energy/config_train_asvspoof2019_bc10 first.
   Please try other projects first.
   After that, please check README in DATA/bc_release

2. If GPU memory is insufficient, please reduce --batch-size in 01_train.sh

3. Output score has this following format:

   Output, File name, label, score, confidence
   Output, LA_E_1066571, 1, 19.160793, 20.1

   If label of the trial is given in the protocol file, the label will be: 
     0, which denotes spoof
     1, which denotes bona fide

   If label of the trial is not given in the protocol file, the label will be:
    -1, which means unknown (not provided)

4. Accordingly, the code assumes 0 and 1 as the tables for spoof and bona fide
   trials, respectively. 
     
5. main.py and config.py in this project are slightly different from those in 02_asvspoof, 
   03_asvspoof_mega, 04_asvspoof_toy. Here, the main.py and config.py support merging multiple
   datasets (e.g., ASVspoof and ESPnet) into one training set. 
   Thus, don't mix main.py and config.py from different projects.

6. Not all the models are here due to the messy scripts (e.g., that in M-distance)
   
7. For a high-level explanation on how the functions and objects work in the script, please
   check ../../README.md


That's all
